# MetaEdit Plus - Smart Tag Editor
MetaEdit Plus is an advanced software of a previous project designed to streamline the organization and update of metadata within digital files. Metadata, which refers to the information that describes the content of a file, like its title, artist, author, and creation date, can be efficiently managed across various file types. With MetaEdit Plus, users have the ability to insert, revise, or eliminate metadata from audio and visual files altering details like the artist or album in music files, modifying camera data in photos, or updating authorship in documents. This capability is important for the effective organization of digital collections, simplifying the processes of sorting, searching, and maintaining extensive file libraries. The software is equipped to handle batch editing, which means multiple files can be updated simultaneously.

MetaEdit Plus supports a diverse range of file formats in its Audio Library, including MP3, WAV, WMA, OGG, FLAC, AAC, M4A, and OPUS, as well as in its Video Library, with formats like MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM, and MPG. Its design, inspired by Medio, a software I developed for downloading YouTube videos and extracting audio, ensures a user-friendly experience, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. The interface of MetaEdit Plus stands out for its intuitive design, ensuring users can easily navigate and utilize its features. The layout is clean and straightforward, allowing for quick access to functionalities and smooth operation.

# Getting Started
To initiate MetaEdit Plus, begin by selecting either Video Library or Audio Library from the top dropdown menu to specify the file type you're working with. Then, from the subsequent dropdown, choose the precise format of your files to ensure they're correctly cataloged. After making your selections, hit the Browse button to navigate to and select the folder containing your media files. Upon successful loading, your files should appear in the Directory and the console will acknowledge the detection of the files, including their count.

Directly above the Browse button, you'll find two tabs labeled Production Details and Composition Details. These allow you to toggle between different data entry fields to input the metadata you wish to attach to your files. To add a thumbnail to all files in a folder, simply click on the Picturebox to select an image or drag and drop one into it.

Once you've filled in all the information, press Generate Tags to commence the metadata embedding process for all your files. Conversely, if you need to strip all metadata from your files, click Remove Tags. Use the Archive Inputs to clear and back up your current inputs, while Retrieve Inputs will restore your saved information into the fields. Keep in mind that MetaEdit Plus is periodically updated which means, staying current with the latest version will ensure you have access to the newest enhancements and features.
