## Third-Party Libraries

Two main third-party libraries handle metadata processing and system monitoring:

### TagLib#

TagLib# is a .NET library for reading and writing metadata in media files. It provides robust support for various audio and video formats with reliable tag management capabilities. MetaEdit Plus automatically uses the latest compatible TagLib# version to ensure optimal performance and format support.

- **Website:** [TagLib# GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp)
- **License:** TagLib# is licensed under the LGPL, allowing free use and distribution.

### System.Management

System.Management is a .NET namespace that provides access to management information and management events about the system, devices, and applications. Real-time performance monitoring and system resource tracking during batch operations are powered by System.Management integration.

- **Website:** [System.Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management)
- **License:** System.Management is part of the .NET ecosystem and follows Microsoft's licensing terms.

### Additional Information

For more details about TagLib# and System.Management, including their capabilities and licensing, check their official documentation:

- **TagLib# Documentation:** [TagLib# API Reference](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp/tree/main/docs)
- **System.Management Documentation:** [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management)

If you have questions or issues related to these libraries, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BerndHagen/MetaEdit-Plus-Smart-Tag-Editor/issues) on GitHub.

## **Keyboard Shortcuts and Workflow**

Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts are included to maximize productivity and streamline your metadata editing workflow. These shortcuts work globally throughout the interface.

| Shortcut | Alternative | Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+G` | `F1` | Generate Tags | Apply metadata to all files in the current directory |
| `Ctrl+R` | `F2` | Remove Tags | Remove all metadata from files in the current directory |
| `Ctrl+L` | `F3` | Clear Console | Clear the console output and log history |
| `Ctrl+T` | `F4` | Retrieve Fields | Load previously archived field configurations |
| `Ctrl+S` | `F5` | Archive Fields | Save current field configurations for future use |
| `Ctrl+B` | `F6` | Browse Folder | Open folder browser to select media directory |

## **Performance Monitoring Features**

Built-in performance monitoring helps you track system resource usage during intensive batch operations:

- **CPU Usage:** Track processor utilization during metadata processing operations
- **RAM Usage:** Monitor memory consumption to prevent system slowdowns
- **Disk Usage:** Observe storage device activity during file operations
- **Performance Graphs:** Visual representation of system resource trends over time with live updating charts

## **Main Operations**

MetaEdit Plus provides five core functions for comprehensive metadata management:

**Generate Tags:** Applies all configured metadata fields from both Production and Composition tabs to every file in the selected directory. Each file receives the entered metadata values, an automatic title based on filename, and thumbnail embedding if artwork is selected. Progress is tracked with detailed console logging.

**Remove Tags:** Completely removes all existing metadata from files in the current directory, including text fields, numeric properties, and embedded artwork, returning files to their original untagged state.

**Archive Fields:** Saves all currently entered field data and selected thumbnail image to memory for later use. After archiving, input fields are automatically reset to allow fresh data entry.

**Retrieve Fields:** Instantly restores previously archived field configurations and thumbnail image, repopulating all interface elements with saved data for repeated use across different directories.

**Clear Console:** Resets the console output area by removing all logged messages and reports while preserving current session data and field configurations.

## **Getting Started Guide**

Follow these steps to start managing your media metadata efficiently:

### **Step 1: Configure Your Library**

1. **Select Library Type**
   - Launch **MetaEdit Plus** and choose between `Audio Library` or `Video Library` from the dropdown menu.

2. **Choose File Format**
   - Select your preferred file format from the available options (MP3, MP4, etc.).

### **Step 2: Process Your Files**

1. **Browse Directory**
   - Click the **Browse** button or use `Ctrl+B` to select a folder containing your media files.
   - A file tree will populate with all compatible files found in the directory.

2. **Configure Metadata Fields**

   - **Production Details Tab:**
     - Enter performer, year, composer, publisher, album artist, and copyright information.
     - Use the intelligent placeholder system to guide your input.
     
   - **Composition Details Tab:**
     - Configure track numbers, subtitles, BPM, disc numbers, descriptions, and genre information.
     - Numeric fields include automatic validation to prevent errors.
     
3. **Add Album Artwork**
   - Click the thumbnail area to browse for cover art images.
   - Alternatively, drag and drop image files directly onto the thumbnail.
   - Supported formats include JPG, PNG, GIF, and BMP.

4. **Apply Changes**
   - Click **Generate Tags** or press `Ctrl+G` to apply metadata to all files in the directory.
   - **Monitor Progress:** Watch the console output for real-time processing information and completion status.
   - **Handle Errors:** Review any error messages for files that couldn't be processed.

**Note:** If you encounter processing errors, ensure files are not in use by other applications and that you have write permissions to the target directory. Processing will continue for remaining files even if individual files encounter errors.

## **Field Management System**

Smart input features prevent common data entry errors:

- **Smart Placeholders:** Contextual placeholder text guides data entry and is automatically excluded from processing
- **Input Validation:** Numeric fields (Year, Track Number, Disc Number, BPM) only accept valid numbers
- **Format Consistency:** TagLib# ensures metadata follows industry standards across all files
